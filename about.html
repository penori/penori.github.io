<p>Penori.com strives to create equality between Gorillas and humans. Our staff works day in and day out to provide the best content of Gorillas possible. 2016 was a hard year for us after the Cincinatti zoo put down one of our favorite Gorillas, Harambe. Harambe was more than just a gorilla to us, he was a movement. Harambe led the march in Gorrilaquality and let nobody stand in his way. Until one fateful day when a retarded boy jumped into Harambe's pen. Knowing the boy was clearly retarded, Harambe decided to do the best for the world and drag the boy around until it died. After a few unsuccessful attempts, Harambe was greeted with the barrel of a gun straight to his forehead. The next day Harambe was burried at Arlington National Cemetary, his movement had come to a screeching halt and there was no sign of a revival. Since then the Humans and Gorillas have been clashing mentally and physically. Some Humans go as far to believe that all Gorillas should be eliminated before they recreate the movie "planet of the apes." Koko, Western loland gorilla born 1971, has an intresting stance on the issue. She believes that in order to create equality, we have to equalize the ratio of people to gorillas. Koko explains the situation by saying, "This planet needs another genocide, I don't care which race, gender, or sexuality, but weez need to do something about theez humanns." In Koko's journals we found around her habitat, we can find evidence of her trying to communicate to other Gorillas around the world to form a "union" like system to represent the minority that are gorillas. In her writings we can see that she openly supports the idea of mass genocide of the humans in order to create a more equal society. The last we spoke with Koko was in late June and she said, "I'm excited to see the second gorilla president." We hope Koko is doing well and lives long enough to see equality spread throughout the world. 

We here at Penori.com want what many gorillas in today's society want, equality. Over the years we have seen many minoritys gain equality including, Blacks, Women, white males, and so many more. We are GOING to extend that to gorillas as well. Thank you for your contribution and LETS LEAD THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY!
